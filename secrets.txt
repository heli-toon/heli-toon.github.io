I'm creating an all apps page to showcase most of my projects using react.js, i want to populate the app cards with json data including: 
the status(Whether finished or unfinished), title, imagelocation, size, downloadlinks(android, win, linux, mac, webapp, browserextension, websites.)
Remember for each download link, there could be any number of platform supported and I'll also need to know what platform is being shown
at the moment so that we can show to user as icons. Please write the json format and support react.js code to populate the cards. Minimal explanation.

title
Image
size
status: finished?
download > links, android, win, linux, mac
