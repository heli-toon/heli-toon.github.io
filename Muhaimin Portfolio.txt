Thank you for sharing that, Salay! Here's an updated draft for your _About_ section:
---
Hello, I'm Salay Abdul Muhaimin Kanton, a passionate web developer and desktop application creator with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. With 3 years of learning and building experience, I specialize in creating dynamic websites using React, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and Django and Flask for the backend. I also have a keen interest in exploring the world of Internet of Things (IoT) with Arduino. Additionally, I develop Python desktop applications using Tkinter, bringing my ideas to life on the desktop.

I believe that determination, curiosity, and self-discipline are essential qualities for success in any field. I embody these values in my approach to web development and software creation, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.

That's understandable! Fireship's code might be outdated, and Electron has undergone significant changes since then. The screen recording functionality might have been affected by these changes.

In the latest versions of Electron, the `desktopCapture` API has been deprecated, and you need to use the `desktopCapturer` module instead. This module provides a more robust way of capturing screen content.

To fix the errors, you can try the following:

1. Update the code to use the `desktopCapturer` module instead of `desktopCapture`.
2. Check the Electron documentation for the latest examples and guidelines on screen recording.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations enabled for screen recording.

If you're still facing issues, feel free to share your code and error messages, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot!
